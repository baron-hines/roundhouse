//! An ActiveJob payload on the CRuby lane: a job whose arguments are a
//! record, a String, an Integer, a Symbol, a Time and an Array goes
//! through the drain as a serialized payload, gets equal values back in
//! `perform` (the record looked up again), and a record deleted before
//! the drain runs is a DeserializationError that `discard_on` drops.
