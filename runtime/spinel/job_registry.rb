# The app's ActiveJob payload jobs, by name: how each one's arguments
# are written at `perform_later` and read back when the drain runs it.
#
# GENERATED between the markers — `project::apply_job_registry` writes
# it from `App::job_plans` (see `lower::job_payload`), the same
# marker-span shape `global_id_locator.rb` uses. Per payload job:
#
#   def self.payload_room__push_message_job(room, message)
#     ActiveJob::Payload.build("Room::PushMessageJob", "default",
#       ActiveJob::Arguments.list([ActiveJob::Arguments.record(room.to_gid_uri), …]))
#   end
#
# which the job's `perform_later` hands to `ActiveJob.enqueue_payload`;
# a `when "Room::PushMessageJob"` arm in `perform` that reads each
# argument back with its typed reader and calls `perform`; and, per
# record model a job reads, `locate_<model>_at`, which accepts the model
# or its STI subclasses BY LITERAL NAME (a name from the wire is never
# turned into a class) and raises DeserializationError for a row that is
# gone, as Rails does.
#
# Dispatch is a `case` over the class name, never `constantize`, for
# the reason the locator gives: a class computed from a wire string is
# a shape this pipeline will not emit.

  # ---- Enqueue after commit ------------------------------------------
  #
  # A job that sets `self.enqueue_after_transaction_commit = true` (on
  # itself or `ApplicationJob`, as Lobsters does) is not queued while a
  # transaction is open: the drain runs on its own connection and would
  # look the record up before the COMMIT made it visible, then raise
  # DeserializationError for a row that is about to exist. Rails holds
  # it the same way. `Model.transaction` reports its edges here, through
  # `ActiveRecord::TransactionHooks` (below); held payloads are queued at COMMIT and
  # dropped at ROLLBACK. Rails 8.1's default for the setting is false,
  # and a job that keeps it so is queued at once, as before.
  #
  # Per thread, because the transaction is: each request thread holds
  # its own connection lease. Flat, because `Model.transaction` is.
